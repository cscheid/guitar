# guitar: libgit2 bindings for R

`guitar` gives you programmatic access to git in R, through the
combined magic of [libgit2](http://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/) and
[Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html).

`guitar` is meant to be easy to use with simple classes, and methods
mapping pretty directly into libgit2. If you have a hard time with it,
please file documentation [issues](http://github.com/cscheid/guitar/issues) on github. If you really don't
like it, you can alternatively use the chorus to Cake's 
[homonymous song](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cake/guitar_20026676.html) for
inspiration :)
